# Advent of Code 2019

This [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), my goals are to:

* Learn as much as I can about WebAssembly
* Learn as much as I can about Rust
* Document my learnings in READMEs and code comments

Non-goals:

* Scoring points
* Finishing before January 1... or February 1... or ever.
